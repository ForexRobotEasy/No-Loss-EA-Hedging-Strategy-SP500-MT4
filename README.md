# No Loss EA Hedging Strategy SP500 MT4

No Loss EA Hedging Strategy SP500 MT4 is an expert advisor (EA) developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is a trading strategy designed for the SP500 market using the MetaTrader 4 (MT4) platform.

## Product Description

No Loss EA Hedging Strategy SP500 MT4 is an optimized forex software that aims to minimize losses and maximize profits through a hedging strategy. The EA uses a combination of stop loss, take profit, and trailing stop to manage trades.

The EA allows users to customize various input parameters to suit their trading preferences. These parameters include:

- StopLoss: The stop loss in pips.
- TakeProfit: The take profit in pips.
- TrailingStop: The trailing stop in pips.
- RiskPercentage: The risk percentage per trade.
- MaxSpread: The maximum allowed spread.
- MaxSlippage: The maximum allowed slippage.

The EA automatically calculates the lot size based on the risk percentage, account balance, stop loss, and market tick value. It also enables hedging if it is not already enabled in the MT4 platform.

The EA operates in three main stages: initialization, start, and deinitialization.

In the initialization stage (OnInit), the EA calculates the lot size and enables hedging if necessary.

In the start stage (OnTick), the EA checks for open positions and open orders. If there are no open positions or orders, the EA evaluates the entry conditions and opens an initial trade with the specified lot size, stop loss, and take profit. 

If there are open positions, the EA evaluates the exit conditions and closes all open positions. 

If there are open positions, the EA calculates the trailing stop price and modifies the stop loss to the trailing stop price.

In the deinitialization stage (OnDeinit), the EA closes all open positions before termination.
